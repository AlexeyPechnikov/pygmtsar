For those unfamiliar with subversion, here are some basic commands and approaches

Before you start making any edits, make sure your working copy is up-to-date by
running
	svn up
in the top GMT5SAR directory.  That will minimize any conflicts.

After making any changes to the code, make an entry in the ChangeLog file,
with the most recent changes on top, following the format of others.

If you add any new files, make sure you tell subversion about them, e.g.

svn add mynewfile

Using

svn add mynewdir

will add the directory as well as any files in it.

Likewise, to remove a file from the repository, use

svn remove obsoletefile

Nothing really happens until you decide to commit your changes.
To commit your changes to the repository, use

svn commit -m "short explanation of what you did"

This will upload your changes to the server and tell you what the new
revision number is.  The revision number is for the entire repository
and increases for each commit; there is no unique number per file.

If during commit you get a conflict message, it means that your changes
occurs in an area that one of the other developers _JUST_ committed as
well.  The simplest approach is to answer the question with "fix later"
or something (I don't recall the exact wording), then edit that file.
Update the file with svn up first.  Now, you should easily find sections
marked with
>>>
<<<
showing both yours and the other version of the code.  It is usually easy
to figure out the issue and make the edits.  Because the commit was marked
as a conflict you must first remove the conflict once you are happy with
your changes:

svn resolved <the file in question>

Now you can continue with the commit.

Should you screw up and wish to revert to what it was before your changes, do

svn revert <the file in question>
svn up
